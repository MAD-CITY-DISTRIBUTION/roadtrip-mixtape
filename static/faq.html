        <li> <b> What is this? </b>
        <div class='answer'>

            This is an application that you can use to create road trip playlists. Type in the name of
            your starting and ending points, and the application will create a playlist of music by
            artists that from the area you are traveling through. Drive through Boston you might
            hear Aerosmith or Donna Summer. Drive through New Orleans and you might hear Lil Wayne or Dr.
            John.

            When you click 'Play mixtape' your playlist will start playing.  
            <p></p>

            Each leg is represented on the map by a green dot. If you click on the green dot you'll see info on
            that leg including a list of artists along with the city that they are from.

            <p></p>
            Pressing the next button in the music player will advance you to the next song on the
            roadtrip. The current leg is shown with a red dot.
            <p></p>
            Some Trip Info is shown, including the number of artists on the route. One bit of interesting
            info (at least to me), is the 'Avg distance'. This shows the average distance to the nearest
            artist throughout the course of the trip. The lower the distance, the more musically dense the
            geographic region.  
            <p></p>

            You can also just click anywhere on the map and a list of the most popular local artists will
            be show. If you click the 'Play this location' button, you can listen to the artists.

        <li> <b> How does it work? </b>
        <div class='answer'>
            The app uses the nifty Google Maps API to calculate and display your route. The route is then 
            broken down into 15 minute legs. For each leg, we find the nearest five unplayed artists and use
            them to generate a 15 minute playlist. If there are more than five nearby artists, we chose
            the most popular five. 
            <p></p>

        <li> <b> Does it make Spotify playlists? </b>
        <div class='answer'>
                Not yet, but soon!
        </div>

        <li> <b> What other features are planned? </b>
        <div class='answer'>
            Some possible features in the works:
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Make a mobile version that you can actually take with you on the road.
                <li> Make a version that works with other music services like Spotify
                <li> Allow you to restrict music selected to particular genres or styles
                <li> Incorporate concert info
            </ul>
        </div>

        <li> <b> What technologies does it use? </b>
        <div class='answer'>

            <a href="http://developer.echonest.com">The Echo Nest API</a> is used to get the artist
            location data.  <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google maps API</a> for all the
            mapping and route finding. <a href="http://developer.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> 
            for the music and album art.

# Roadtrip Mixtape

This is an application that you can use to create road trip playlists. Type in the name of
your starting and ending points, and the application will create a playlist of music by
artists that from the area you are traveling through. Drive through Boston you might
hear Aerosmith or Donna Summer. Drive through New Orleans and you might hear Lil Wayne or Dr.
John.
